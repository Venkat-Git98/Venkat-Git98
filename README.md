**Machine Learning Engineer | Applied AI & LLM Solutions | Cloud & MLOps | Data Science Consultant**

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer with experience building end-to-end AI systems that combine deep learning, natural language processing, and cloud-native infrastructure. I enjoy working on real-world problems that require not just strong models, but also reliable and scalable deployment strategies.

Currently, Iâ€™m working at **ScriptChain Health**, where I lead the development of AI-driven solutions for healthcare applications, including predictive modeling for hospital readmissions. My work integrates neural networksand large language models (LLMs), with a strong focus on performance, compliance, and interpretability.

In parallel, I serve as a **Data Consultant** at The George Washington University, supporting faculty and students across disciplines in applying statistical methods, ML models, and research best practices using tools like R, Python, and Tableau.
